# Memcache Server


#### Some thoughts / TODO
    * Strip off \r\n -- IMPORTANT
    * Figure out if malloc and such is in the right spot
    * Add in locks -- IMPORTANT, reader writer etc
    * Understand how the timeout works
    * Implement increasing unique 64 bit CAS UNIQUE thingy -- with locks
